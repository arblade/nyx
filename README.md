## Why ?

We are dealing with specific rules of different IPS, and we need to find a common basis to discharge analyst from the burden of knowing all the details of one IPS. A simple format, like Sigma, will allow all analysts to craft their own rules.
We want this format to be extensive, as the network rules can be fine tuned to be more efficient following ueach IPS specificities.
