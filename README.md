## Why ?

We are dealing with specific rules of different IPS/IDS, and we need to find a common basis to discharge analyst from the burden of knowing all the details of multiple IPS/IDS. A simple format, like Sigma, will allow all analysts to easily craft their own rules.
We want this format to be extensive, as the network rules can be fine tuned to be more efficient following each IPS/IDS specificities.

## Philosophy

We don't want to be exhaustive and fully compliant with one format or another, our objective is to conceptualize network rules and remove useless complexities from analysts.

We will first focus on suricata and snort formats.
